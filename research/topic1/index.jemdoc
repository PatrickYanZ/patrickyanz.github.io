= Joint Optimization of V2I communication and Autonomous Driving on HighwayEnv

Jointly optimizing AV motion dynamics and wireless connectivity is critical to balancing the trade-offs between communication handovers and  speed of AVs  in order to achieve the following
- Receive real-time traffic information from the wireless network
- Access timely navigation data
- Communicate effectively with surrounding vehicles
- Predict dangerous situations and make informed decisions
