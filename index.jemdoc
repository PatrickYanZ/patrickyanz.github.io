== Bio
I am a researcher specializing in wireless networks and AI-driven vehicular communication. I earned my BSc in Computer Science and Statistics from York University, where I researched in the Next Generation Wireless Networks Lab under [https://sites.google.com/view/ngwn-research-lab/home?authuser=0 Prof. Hina Tabassum]. My work focuses on optimizing beyond 5G/6G networks, deep reinforcement learning for autonomous driving, and AI-enabled vehicular communication. I aim to develop scalable, efficient solutions to enhance safety and performance in vehicular networks. Currently, I am exploring resource-aware communication, quantum-enhanced user association, and hybrid language models for optimizing driving and telecommunication policies, combining technical expertise with impactful research.
